# SFML-PROJECTS

This repository contains various games and graphical projects created using **C++** combined with **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**.  
These projects were developed as part of my learning journey in game development and C++ programming.

## About
The projects include small experiments as well as more complete game prototypes. Each project is contained in its own folder, and demonstrates different aspects of SFML, such as:

- Rendering graphics and shapes
- Handling user input (keyboard and mouse)
- Basic game logic and state management
- Working with sounds and music
- Collision detection and simple physics
